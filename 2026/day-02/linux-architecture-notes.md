## Linux Architecture / Linux Layered Design
Hardware → Physical components (CPU, RAM, disk, devices)

Kernel → Core of Linux that manages hardware, memory, processes, and devices

Shell → Interface that allows users to interact with the system (command line)

Applications → User programs like browsers, editors, servers running on top of the system

👉 Flow: User → Applications → Shell → Kernel → Hardware

## Processes in Linux
A process is simply a program in execution that has a unique PID and is managed by the kernel for creation, scheduling, and termination.

-Process Lifecycle

--New

--Ready

--Running

--Waiting

--Terminated
-Useful Commands
--ps
--top
--htop
--kill
--pstree
Example:

Start program → process created

Close app → process terminated

## Systemd 
systemd is the modern Linux init system that manages the boot process, controls system services, handles logging, and can automatically restart services when needed.

What systemd does

Boot process management

Service management

Logging (journal)

Dependency handling

Parallel startup

📌 Key Concepts

Unit → configuration file (service, socket, mount)

Service → background program (daemon)

Target → group of units (like runlevels)

📌 Important Commands
systemctl start nginx
systemctl stop nginx
systemctl restart nginx
systemctl status nginx
systemctl enable nginx

👉 Example:

Web server runs as service

systemd starts it automatically

## 5 Commands used daily
ps or top : Provides process ID, memory usage, CPU time and command name which is crucial for monitoring system performance and troubleshooting.
chmod : Changing permission of files.
ssh : Provides secure shell connecting to remote server.
systemctl : Managing system services (starting, stopping).
df /du : df is used to monitor disk space usage and du is used to estimate size of a specific directory.a
