## Task 1: First Script
1. Create a file `hello.sh`
2. Add the shebang line `#!/bin/bash` at the top
3. Print `Hello, DevOps!` using `echo`
4. Make it executable and run it

[Script](scripts/hello.sh)

* What happens if you remove the shebang line?
 - The script runs after removing shebang line :
    - `./hello.sh` - The kernel checks for a shebang to identify the interpreter.If no shebang is found, the script is executed using the current shell.
    - `bash hello.sh` - The script is explicitly executed by the Bash shell,independent of the presence of a shebang.
    - `sh hello.sh` - The script is executed using the `sh shell`,which may differ in behavior from bash
