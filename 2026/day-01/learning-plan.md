## My Understanding of DevOps & Cloud Engineering

DevOps is a culture and set of practices that combines development and operations to deliver software faster, reliably, and continuously.

Cloud Engineering focuses on building, deploying, and managing applications using cloud platforms like
Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.

-  DevOps + Cloud together enable:

- - Reliable systems

## Why I’m Starting DevOps & Cloud

- To move beyond traditional development

- To understand real production systems
